  # Why copy them all?

  # Why copy only pngs?
  # Rendering of `svg` is hard! Not that it's costly in cpu time, but that the
  # rendering might not be as expected depending on what renders it.
  # The SVGs in that directory are used as an authoring format files, not files
  # to be used as they are. They need to be pre-rendered.
