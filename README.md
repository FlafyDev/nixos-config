# NixOS Configuration
All my machines are being managed by Nix with the code in this repository.  
This config uses [Combined Manager](https://github.com/FlafyDev/combined-manager).  


`hosts` - Machine specific configuration files.  
`modules` - Personalized nix modules.  


### Declarative TODO
- Firefox Extensions settings (Sidebery, remember bitwarden account, enable extensions by default)
- Secrets (SSH keys)
- Use as little Home Manager as possible
